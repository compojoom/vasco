    <title>Introduction</title>

    <section>
      <title>Introducing Mydigipass</title>

      <para><ulink url="http://mydigipass.com">Mydigipass.com</ulink>™ is a
      security service aiming to protect your online identity. The service is
      developed by the VASCO® Data Security GmbH and through this
      documentation we will just call it Mydigipass API. </para>

      <para>The Mydigipass package distributed through compojoom.com is a
      collection of modules and plugins that makes integrating the mydigipass
      API with your Joomla! site a breeze. </para>

      <para>So what does mydigipass.com exactly do?</para>

      <para>On typical Joomla! site, users login with email addresses and
      static passwords: <emphasis>something they know</emphasis>. Two-factor
      authentication adds <emphasis>something they have</emphasis> to the
      authentication process. If you install and configure the mydigipass
      package on your Joomla site, users will securely login by generating a
      OTP (one time password) using their authenticator by scanning a QR code
      with their mobile devices, authenticating via the embedded DIGIPASS in
      Intel® IPT on their laptop, ob by using on of the digipass hardware
      tokens. The authenticator is <emphasis>what the user has </emphasis>and
      is the second authentication factor. </para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Installation and updates</title>

    <para>Installing Mydigipass is no different than installing any other
    Joomla!™ extension on your site. You can read the complete instructions
    for installing Joomla!™ extensions on the <ulink
    url="http://help.joomla.org/content/view/1476/235/">official help
    page</ulink> .Throughout this chapter we assume that you are familiar with
    these instructions and we will not duplicate them.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Getting the installation packages</title>

      <para>The mydigipass package is located under Downloads -&gt; Official
      releases -&gt; Mydigipass. The releases are listed with the newest
      release always on top. Once you click on the release number you'll see
      the available files for download.</para>

      <para>You can use the installation package to update from previous
      version as well; just install it, without uninstalling the old
      package.</para>

      <para><note>
          <para>The zip package includes all available modules and plugins.
          During the installation they will be installed automatically.</para>
        </note></para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Installing a developer release</title>

      <para>In normal cases you won't have to install developer releases. You
      are advised to go to the download area and grab the normal package as
      described in the past chapter. However there are situations where things
      are not working - if we confirm the problem, we fix it and generally
      release a developer release to test the fix. We proceed the same way
      with new features - we add them and create a developer release for those
      of you who like to experiment with them before the official release gets
      published.</para>

      <para>To get the latest developer release navigate to Downloads -&gt;
      Developer Releases -&gt; Mydigipass. The latest release is always on
      top. Download the package and install it through the Joomla extension
      manager.</para>

      <important>
        <para>Please note: Having a backup is never a bad idea!</para>
      </important>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Updating to the latest version</title>

      <section>
        <title>Checking for the latest version and upgrading</title>

        <para>We use the standard Joomla update manager to notify you about
        updates. In your Joomla backend click on Extensions-&gt; Extension
        Manager -&gt; Update and click on Find updates.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Uninstall</title>

      <para>You can uninstall the Mydigipass package just as any other Joomla
      extension. Just navigate to Extensions -&gt; Extension Manager -&gt;
      Manage -&gt; search for Mydigipass (package), select it and click
      uninstall. The uninstall process will remove all installed plugins and
      modules as well.</para>
